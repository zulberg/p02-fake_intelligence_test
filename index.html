    <h1>Welcome to the Mock Intelligence Test</h1>
    <h2>The purpose of this test is to determine if you can figure out the logic behind a series of problems
      that involve only two numbers.  Each of the next three pages consist of a series of sample problems with
      their solutions, with two problems at the bottom for you to solve.  This test is only six total problems.
      A final page with your score will be displayed after the test.</h2>
